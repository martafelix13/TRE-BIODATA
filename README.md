# TREBIODATA


## Development server

To run the backend service for the authentication:
```bash
cd backend 
node index.js
```

To start a local development server go back to the TRE-BIODATA folder and run:
```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:80/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.


## Building

To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.
